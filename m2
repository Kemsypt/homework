<h1>M2: Assess How Dietary Intake and Nutritional Health Are Influenced by Dietary Habits and Lifestyle Choices</h1>

<h2>Christos</h2>

<h3>1) What dietary habits and lifestyle choices might Christos have?</h3>
<p>
Christos is 70, lives alone in a village with restricted public transport, and he does not enjoy cooking. Because he does not have a car and only has a convenience store nearby, he is likely to choose foods that are quick and easy. Even though he can afford food, the limited access and low motivation to cook could mean he relies on ready meals, tinned foods, packaged snacks, or simple options like bread-based meals. Living alone can also make people less motivated to prepare balanced meals, so he may skip meals or repeat the same easy foods. His lifestyle may also be less active if he does not travel much, which matters for weight and blood sugar control.
</p>

<h3>2) What foods might Christos eat too much or too little of?</h3>
<p>
Christos might eat too much of refined starchy foods like white bread and sugary snacks if these are the easiest options in the convenience store. He may also eat too many processed foods, which often contain a lot of salt and saturated fat. At the same time, he might eat too little fruit and vegetables, and he may not get enough wholegrains, fibre, or lean protein if he is avoiding cooking or shopping is difficult.
</p>

<h3>3) What nutrients might Christos have too much or too little of?</h3>
<p>
Christos could have too much sugar if he regularly eats sweets, cakes, biscuits, or sugary drinks, and he could have too much saturated fat and sodium if he relies on processed meals and snacks. He could have too little fibre if he does not eat enough wholegrains, beans, fruit, and vegetables, which can make blood glucose harder to manage and can also affect digestion. He could also have too little protein if he is not eating foods like fish, eggs, beans, or lean meat often enough, which can lead to muscle loss in older age. Vitamin D can also be low in older adults, especially if they do not spend much time outside, and that can affect bone strength.

<h3>4) What might be the impact on Christos’ health?</h3>
<p>
Since Christos has Type 2 diabetes, eating too many refined carbohydrates and sugary foods could cause frequent blood glucose spikes and make his condition harder to manage. Over time, poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of complications such as heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and eye problems. If his diet is high in salt, his blood pressure could rise, which increases the risk of stroke and heart problems. If he is not eating enough protein and overall nutrients, he may become weaker and more frail, which increases the risk of falls. On the positive side, if he chooses more wholegrain carbohydrates, eats more vegetables, and includes healthier proteins and unsaturated fats like olive oil, it could help stabilise his blood glucose and support heart health.
</p>

<h3>5) Alternative method of feeding and the impact on one individual</h3>
<p>
An alternative method of feeding that could be used for Christos is oral nutritional supplements, such as prescribed nutritional drinks, if he begins to lose weight or struggles to eat enough. These can help increase calorie and protein intake and lower the risk of malnutrition and muscle loss. However, because he has Type 2 diabetes, the type of supplement matters, since some can be high in sugar and could raise his blood glucose. If supplements were needed, they should be chosen carefully and monitored by a healthcare professional so they support nutrition without worsening his diabetes control.

<h2>Mary</h2>

<h3>1) What dietary habits and lifestyle choices might Mary have?</h3>
<p>
Mary is 27, a single mum, four months pregnant, vegetarian, and lactose intolerant, and she lives on benefits in a busy town. Her lifestyle is likely to be stressful and time-limited because she is caring for a three year old while pregnant. This may make her more likely to choose quick meals and snacks rather than cooking from scratch. Being vegetarian and lactose intolerant means she already avoids meat, fish, and regular dairy, so her diet depends a lot on whether she replaces these foods properly with alternatives. Since she is on a low income, she may buy cheaper foods that are filling, and that can sometimes mean more processed options.
</p>

<h3>2) What foods might Mary eat too much or too little of?</h3>
<p>
Mary might eat too much of cheaper, quick foods that are high in refined carbohydrates, added sugar, or saturated fat, especially if she is relying on processed vegetarian meals and snacks. She might also end up eating too little high quality protein if she does not regularly include foods like beans, lentils, tofu, eggs, nuts, and seeds. She could also eat too little calcium-rich foods if she avoids dairy but does not use fortified plant alternatives, and she might not get enough iron-rich foods if she is not planning meals carefully during pregnancy.
</p>

<h3>3) What nutrients might Mary have too much or too little of?</h3>
<p>
Mary could have too little iron because pregnancy increases iron needs, and vegetarian iron from foods like lentils and spinach is harder for the body to absorb than iron from meat. If iron is low, she could develop iron deficiency anaemia, which can cause tiredness and weakness. She could also have too little vitamin B12, because it is mainly found in animal products, so she may need fortified foods or supplements to avoid deficiency. Calcium could be too low because she is lactose intolerant, unless she uses fortified plant milks, fortified yoghurts, tofu set with calcium, or other calcium sources. She could also have too little vitamin D, iodine, and omega 3 fats, which are important in pregnancy for overall health and the baby’s development.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Mary could have too much sugar and too many refined carbohydrates if she relies on snack foods, sweet drinks, or cheaper processed meals. She could also have too much saturated fat and sodium if she eats lots of ready meals, takeaway foods, or processed vegetarian meat substitutes, since these can be high in salt and added fats. Too much sodium is especially risky in pregnancy because it can contribute to raised blood pressure, and too much sugar and excess calories can increase the risk of unhealthy weight gain and gestational diabetes.
</p>

<h3>4) What might be the impact on Mary’s health?</h3>
<p>
If Mary does not meet her nutrient needs during pregnancy, it could affect both her and her baby. Low iron can lead to anaemia and stronger tiredness, and it can increase risks in pregnancy. Low calcium and vitamin D can affect her bone health and the baby’s bone development. Low vitamin B12 can affect the nervous system and can be harmful for the baby’s development. If her diet becomes high in sugar, saturated fat, and salt, she may gain too much weight during pregnancy, and this can increase the risk of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. On the other hand, a well-planned vegetarian diet that includes beans, lentils, wholegrains, fruit, vegetables, and fortified dairy alternatives can still be balanced and healthy for pregnancy.
