  <h1>M2: Assess How Dietary Intake and Nutritional Health Are Influenced by Dietary Habits and Lifestyle Choices</h1>

  <hr />

  <h1>1. What Dietary Habits and Lifestyle Choices Might the Individuals Have?</h1>

  <h2>Christos</h2>
  <p>
    Christos is 70 years old, lives alone in a village with limited public transport, and does not enjoy cooking.
    Even though he has money, his location and motivation will strongly influence what he eats. Since he lives near a
    convenience store, he may rely on ready meals, tinned foods, white bread, pastries, and other quick options.
    Older people who live alone sometimes skip meals or eat small portions because cooking feels like too much effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    He also has Type 2 diabetes, which means he should manage his carbohydrate intake carefully. However, if he prefers
    easy foods, he may eat too many refined carbohydrates and sugary foods. His lifestyle may also be quite sedentary if
    he does not travel much or socialise often.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Mary</h2>
  <p>
    Mary is 27, pregnant, a single mum, vegetarian and lactose intolerant. She lives on benefits in a busy town.
    Her lifestyle likely includes looking after her three year old while managing pregnancy. This may limit time for
    cooking.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because she is vegetarian, she does not eat meat or fish. Because she is lactose intolerant, she cannot consume
    regular dairy. This already removes two major food groups from her diet unless she replaces them properly. Since she
    lives on benefits, she might choose cheaper foods, which can sometimes be more processed and high in fat, salt and
    sugar.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h1>2. What Foods Might They Eat Too Much or Too Little Of?</h1>

  <h2>Christos</h2>
  <p>He might eat too much:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Refined carbohydrates such as white bread and pastries</li>
    <li>Processed foods high in salt</li>
    <li>Sugary snacks</li>
  </ul>

  <p>He might eat too little:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fresh fruit and vegetables</li>
    <li>Fibre</li>
    <li>Lean protein</li>
    <li>Wholegrains</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Convenience foods are often high in saturated fat and salt. If he relies on these, he could be consuming too much
    sodium and unhealthy fats.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Mary</h2>
  <p>She might eat too much:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheap processed vegetarian foods</li>
    <li>Foods high in carbohydrates</li>
    <li>Snack foods if she is busy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>She might eat too little:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Iron rich foods</li>
    <li>Vitamin B12</li>
    <li>Calcium</li>
    <li>High quality protein</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If she does not replace meat and dairy properly, she could miss key nutrients. Vegetarian diets can be healthy, but
    they need planning.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h1>3. What Nutrients Might They Have Too Much or Too Little Of?</h1>

  <h2>Christos</h2>
  <p>Too much:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Saturated fat</li>
    <li>Sodium</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Too little:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fibre</li>
    <li>Vitamin D</li>
    <li>Protein</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Too much sugar and refined carbohydrates can raise blood glucose levels. This is especially dangerous with Type 2
    diabetes. Too much sodium increases blood pressure, raising the risk of heart disease and stroke.
  </p>
  <p>
    Too little fibre can make blood sugar harder to control and cause digestive issues. Low protein intake in older
    adults can lead to muscle loss and weakness. Older people are also at risk of low vitamin D, which affects bone
    strength.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Mary</h2>
  <p>Too little:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Iron</li>
    <li>Vitamin B12</li>
    <li>Calcium</li>
    <li>Iodine</li>
    <li>Omega 3 fatty acids</li>
    <li>Vitamin D</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Because Mary is vegetarian and pregnant, her iron needs are higher. If she does not eat enough iron rich plant foods
    or combine them with vitamin C, she could develop iron deficiency anaemia. This can cause tiredness, dizziness and
    increase risks during pregnancy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vitamin B12 is mainly found in animal products, so she may not get enough unless she eats fortified foods or takes
    supplements. A deficiency could affect nerve function and the baby’s development.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since she is lactose intolerant, she may not consume enough calcium unless she drinks fortified plant milk. Calcium
    is essential for the baby’s bones and for protecting her own bone health. Iodine is also important in pregnancy for
    brain development, and vegetarian diets can sometimes be low in this nutrient.
  </p>

  <p>Too much:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Carbohydrates</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Saturated fat</li>
    <li>Sodium</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If Mary relies on cheaper processed vegetarian foods, she may eat too many refined carbohydrates and added sugars.
    This could lead to excessive weight gain during pregnancy and increase the risk of gestational diabetes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some processed vegetarian foods, such as meat substitutes and ready meals, can also be high in saturated fat and
    salt. Too much sodium can raise blood pressure, which is dangerous in pregnancy and may increase the risk of
    complications such as pre eclampsia.
  </p>
  <p>
    This shows that while a vegetarian diet can be healthy, it depends on food choices. Poor planning could lead to both
    nutrient deficiencies and excess intake of less healthy nutrients.
  </p>

  <h1>4. What Might Be the Impact on Their Health?</h1>

  <h2>Christos</h2>
  <p>
    If Christos eats too many refined carbohydrates and sugary foods, his blood glucose levels may remain high. Long term
    poor diabetes control increases the risk of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Heart disease</li>
    <li>Kidney damage</li>
    <li>Nerve damage</li>
    <li>Vision problems</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Too much salt increases blood pressure, which adds to his cardiovascular risk. If he does not eat enough protein, he
    may lose muscle mass and become frail. This increases the risk of falls.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the positive side, if he chooses wholegrains, vegetables, lean protein and healthy fats such as olive oil, he
    could improve blood sugar control and reduce complications.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Mary</h2>
  <p>
    If Mary does not meet her increased nutritional needs during pregnancy, there could be serious effects. Low iron can
    cause anaemia, tiredness and low birth weight. Low calcium could affect her own bone health and the baby’s bone
    development. Low B12 could affect neurological development.
  </p>
  <p>
    If she consumes too many processed foods, she may gain excessive weight during pregnancy. This increases the risk of
    gestational diabetes and high blood pressure.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, a well planned vegetarian diet with fortified foods and supplements can fully support a healthy pregnancy.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h1>5. Alternative Method of Feeding and Its Impact</h1>
  <p>An alternative method of feeding could be oral nutritional supplements for Christos.</p>

  <p>
    If he begins losing weight or struggles to eat balanced meals, prescribed nutritional drinks could help increase his
    calorie and protein intake. This may prevent malnutrition and muscle loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, some supplements contain sugar, which could affect his blood glucose levels. Therefore, diabetic specific
    supplements would need to be used and monitored by a healthcare professional.
  </p>

  <p>This shows that alternative feeding methods can support health, but they must match the person’s medical condition.</p>

  <hr />

  <h1>Overall Assessment</h1>
  <p>
    Christos’ age, diabetes and living situation increase his risk of high blood sugar, heart disease and possible
    undernutrition if his diet is unbalanced. Mary’s pregnancy, vegetarian diet and lactose intolerance increase her risk
    of nutrient deficiencies if she does not carefully plan her food choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Both individuals show how lifestyle, health conditions and personal choices directly influence dietary intake and
    long term health outcomes.
