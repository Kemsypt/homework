<h1>M2 Assessment</h1>
<p><strong>Assess how dietary intake and nutritional health are influenced by dietary habits and lifestyle choices</strong></p>
<p>I will answer each part clearly for Christos and Mary using the same layout.</p>

<h1>Christos</h1>

<h2>1. What dietary habits and lifestyle choices might he have?</h2>
<p>
  Christos is 70, lives alone in a village with restricted public transport and only has a convenience store nearby.
  He does not enjoy cooking. Because of this, he is likely to buy easy, quick foods such as ready meals, tinned foods,
  white bread, pastries or microwave meals. Living alone may also mean he does not feel motivated to cook proper meals
  and might skip meals or eat small portions.
</p>
<p>
  He has Type 2 diabetes, so ideally he should monitor his sugar intake, but if he chooses convenience foods, he may not
  always make the healthiest choices. His age also means he may be less physically active, which affects how his body uses energy.
</p>

<h2>2. Based on these factors, what foods might he eat too much or too little of?</h2>
<p><strong>He may eat too much:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Refined carbohydrates such as white bread and sugary snacks</li>
  <li>Processed foods high in salt</li>
  <li>Saturated fats from ready meals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>He may eat too little:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fresh fruit and vegetables</li>
  <li>Fibre</li>
  <li>Lean protein</li>
  <li>Wholegrain carbohydrates</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Because he shops at a convenience store, he may not have access to a wide variety of fresh foods. This could limit his intake
  of important nutrients.
</p>

<h2>3. What specific nutrients might he have too much or too little of?</h2>
<p><strong>He may have too much:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sugar, which raises blood glucose levels</li>
  <li>Sodium, which increases blood pressure</li>
  <li>Saturated fat, which raises cholesterol</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>He may have too little:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fibre, which helps control blood sugar and digestion</li>
  <li>Vitamin D, which older adults are often low in</li>
  <li>Protein, which is needed to maintain muscle mass</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Too much sugar can worsen his diabetes. Too much salt increases the risk of heart disease. Too little protein can lead to muscle loss and weakness.
</p>

<h2>4. What might be the impact on his health?</h2>
<p>
  If he continues to eat high sugar and high fat foods, his blood glucose may remain unstable. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of
  heart disease, kidney damage and nerve problems. High salt intake could also increase his risk of stroke.
</p>
<p>
  If he does not eat enough protein, he may become frail. Frailty increases the risk of falls, which can be serious at his age.
</p>
<p>
  However, if he chooses wholegrains, vegetables, lean protein and healthier cooking methods like grilling or baking,
  he could improve his blood sugar control and reduce long term health risks.
</p>

<h2>5. Assess an alternative method of feeding and its impact</h2>
<p>
  An alternative method for Christos could be prescribed oral nutritional supplements if he became undernourished.
</p>
<p>
  These supplements can provide extra calories and protein, which would help prevent weight loss and muscle wasting. This could improve his strength and energy levels.
</p>
<p>
  However, some supplements contain sugar. For someone with Type 2 diabetes, this could raise blood glucose levels if not carefully monitored.
  Therefore, supplements would need to be diabetes appropriate and supervised by a healthcare professional.
</p>

<h1>Mary</h1>

<h2>1. What dietary habits and lifestyle choices might she have?</h2>
<p>
  Mary is 27, pregnant, vegetarian and lactose intolerant. She is also a single mum living on benefits. Because she is pregnant,
  her nutritional needs are higher. As a vegetarian, she does not eat meat or fish. Because she is lactose intolerant,
  she cannot have regular dairy products.
</p>
<p>
  Living on a low income may mean she chooses cheaper foods, which can sometimes be processed and high in sugar or fat.
  She also has a young child, so she may not always have time to prepare balanced meals.
</p>

<h2>2. Based on these factors, what foods might she eat too much or too little of?</h2>
<p><strong>She may eat too much:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Processed vegetarian foods</li>
  <li>Refined carbohydrates</li>
  <li>Sugary snacks if they are cheaper and convenient</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>She may eat too little:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Iron rich foods</li>
  <li>Vitamin B12</li>
  <li>Calcium</li>
  <li>High quality protein</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If she does not use fortified dairy alternatives, she may struggle to meet her calcium needs.
</p>

<h2>3. What specific nutrients might she have too much or too little of?</h2>
<p><strong>She may have too much:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Sugar</li>
  <li>Saturated fat from processed vegetarian foods</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>She may have too little:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Iron, which is important in pregnancy</li>
  <li>Vitamin B12, mainly found in animal products</li>
  <li>Calcium, due to lactose intolerance</li>
  <li>Protein, if not carefully planned</li>
  <li>Folic acid, if she does not take supplements</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Iron deficiency could cause anaemia, leading to fatigue and increased risk during pregnancy. Low B12 could affect the baby’s nervous system.
  Low calcium could affect bone development.
</p>

<h2>4. What might be the impact on her health?</h2>
<p>
  If Mary does not meet her nutritional needs, she could become anaemic and feel extremely tired. This could make caring for her child more difficult.
  Poor nutrition during pregnancy can also increase the risk of low birth weight or developmental issues.
</p>
<p>
  If she eats too many high fat and high sugar foods, she may gain excessive weight during pregnancy. This increases the risk of gestational diabetes
  and high blood pressure.
</p>
<p>
  However, if she plans her meals carefully using beans, lentils, wholegrains, vegetables and fortified plant milks, she can meet her needs.
  Taking recommended supplements such as folic acid can reduce the risk of birth defects.
</p>

<h2>5. Assess an alternative method of feeding and its impact</h2>
<p>
  An alternative feeding method for Mary could be breastfeeding after the baby is born.
</p>
<p>
  Breastfeeding provides ideal nutrition for the baby and supports the baby’s immune system. It also helps the mother bond with the baby
  and can reduce the risk of certain illnesses later in the child’s life.
</p>
<p>
  However, breastfeeding increases the mother’s nutritional needs even further. If Mary is already low in nutrients such as iron or B12,
  this could make her more tired. She would need to ensure she eats enough calories and nutrients to support both herself and her baby.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Overall Summary</h2>
<p>
  Both Christos and Mary are strongly influenced by their lifestyle and personal circumstances. Christos’ age, diabetes and isolation increase his risk
  of poor blood sugar control and heart disease. Mary’s pregnancy, vegetarian diet and low income increase her risk of nutrient deficiencies.
  In both cases, balanced food choices are essential to prevent long term health problems.
