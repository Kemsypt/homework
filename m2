<h1>M2: Assess How the Dietary Intake and Nutritional Health of the Selected Individuals Are Influenced by Their Dietary Habits and Lifestyle Choices</h1>

<h2>Christos</h2>

<h3>Question 1: What dietary habits and lifestyle choices might the individual have?</h3>
<p>
Christos is 70 years old and lives alone in a village with restricted public transport. He does not own a car and only lives near a convenience store. Even though he has a good pension and savings, his location and the fact that he does not enjoy cooking are likely to influence his diet. He may rely heavily on ready meals, tinned foods, white bread, pastries and other quick options that are easy to prepare. Living alone may also reduce his motivation to cook balanced meals, meaning he could skip meals or eat repetitive, simple foods.
</p>
<p>
He has Type 2 diabetes, so ideally he should monitor his carbohydrate intake carefully. However, if he prefers convenience foods, he may consume too many refined carbohydrates and sugary products. His lifestyle may also be fairly inactive due to limited transport and his age, which could affect his weight and blood glucose control.
</p>

<h3>Question 2: Based on these factors, what foods might he eat too much or too little of and what specific nutrients might he have too much or too little of?</h3>
<p>
Christos may eat too many refined carbohydrates such as white bread and pastries, as well as processed foods that are high in salt and saturated fat. He may also consume sugary snacks and sweet drinks, which can negatively affect blood glucose levels. At the same time, he may not eat enough fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, fibre and lean protein sources such as fish, beans or eggs.
</p>
<p>
In terms of nutrients, he may have too much sugar, saturated fat and sodium. Excess sugar can cause blood glucose spikes, which is particularly harmful for someone with Type 2 diabetes. Too much sodium can increase blood pressure, raising the risk of heart disease and stroke. He may also have too little fibre, protein and vitamin D. Low fibre intake can make blood sugar harder to manage and cause digestive problems. Inadequate protein can lead to muscle loss in older adults, and low vitamin D can weaken bones.
</p>

<h3>Question 3: What might be the impact on his health? Consider both positive and negative effects.</h3>
<p>
If Christos continues to consume high amounts of refined carbohydrates and sugary foods, his diabetes may become poorly controlled. Long term poor blood glucose control increases the risk of heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage and vision problems. High salt intake could raise his blood pressure and increase his cardiovascular risk. Low protein intake could lead to muscle loss and frailty, increasing the likelihood of falls.
</p>
<p>
However, if he improves his diet by choosing wholegrain carbohydrates, lean protein, more vegetables and healthy fats such as olive oil, he could stabilise his blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of complications. A balanced diet could also improve his energy levels and overall well being.
</p>

<h3>Question 4: Assess an alternative method of feeding and include the impact on this individual.</h3>
<p>
An alternative method of feeding for Christos could be prescribed oral nutritional supplements if he begins to lose weight or struggles to meet his nutritional needs. These supplements can provide additional calories and protein, helping to prevent malnutrition and muscle loss.
</p>
<p>
However, some supplements contain sugar, which could raise blood glucose levels. For this reason, diabetic specific supplements would need to be chosen and monitored by a healthcare professional. If used correctly, they could support his nutritional health, but if used incorrectly, they could worsen his diabetes control.
</p>

<h2>Mary</h2>

<h3>Question 1: What dietary habits and lifestyle choices might the individual have?</h3>
<p>
Mary is 27 years old, four months pregnant and a single mother to a three year old child. She lives in a busy town and relies on benefits. She is vegetarian and lactose intolerant. Her daily routine likely involves caring for her child while managing her pregnancy, which may limit the time and energy she has for cooking.
</p>
<p>
Because she is vegetarian, she does not eat meat or fish. Because she is lactose intolerant, she cannot consume regular dairy products. This removes key food groups from her diet unless she replaces them carefully. Living on a limited income may lead her to buy cheaper foods, which can sometimes be processed and high in fat, sugar and salt.
</p>

<h3>Question 2: Based on these factors, what foods might she eat too much or too little of and what specific nutrients might she have too much or too little of?</h3>
<p>
Mary may eat too many processed vegetarian foods, refined carbohydrates and convenient snack foods if she is busy and managing on a budget. Some meat substitutes and ready meals can be high in saturated fat and sodium. She may also consume foods high in sugar, especially if she relies on affordable snack items.
</p>
<p>
She may not eat enough iron rich foods, vitamin B12 sources, calcium rich alternatives or high quality protein if her vegetarian diet is not carefully planned. Nutritionally, she may have low iron, vitamin B12, calcium, iodine, omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin D. Pregnancy increases the need for iron and other nutrients, and plant based iron is not absorbed as efficiently as iron from meat. She may also consume too much sugar, saturated fat and sodium if her diet includes frequent processed foods.
</p>

<h3>Question 3: What might be the impact on her health? Consider both positive and negative effects.</h3>
<p>
If Mary does not meet her increased nutritional needs during pregnancy, there could be serious consequences. Low iron intake can cause anaemia, tiredness and increase the risk of low birth weight. Low calcium intake could affect her own bone health and the baby’s bone development. Vitamin B12 deficiency could affect neurological development in the baby.
</p>
<p>
If she consumes excessive sugar and refined carbohydrates, she may gain too much weight during pregnancy, increasing the risk of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. High sodium intake could also increase the risk of complications such as pre eclampsia.
</p>
<p>
On the positive side, a well planned vegetarian diet that includes beans, lentils, wholegrains, fruit, vegetables and fortified plant milks can fully support a healthy pregnancy. If she takes recommended supplements such as folic acid and vitamin D, she can reduce the risk of deficiencies and support her baby’s development.
</p>

<h3>Question 4: Assess an alternative method of feeding and include the impact on this individual.</h3>
<p>
An alternative feeding approach for Mary could include the use of pregnancy specific nutritional supplements, such as iron, folic acid and vitamin B12 tablets, especially if blood tests show deficiencies. These supplements can help ensure she meets her increased nutritional needs during pregnancy.
</p>
<p>
However, supplements should not replace a balanced diet. Taking excessive amounts of certain vitamins can be harmful. If used correctly under medical advice, supplements could protect both her health and her baby’s development. If misused, they could lead to imbalances or health risks.
